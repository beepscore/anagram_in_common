## Problem
Given two strings a and b, each contains only ascii lowercase a-z.
Remove the minumum number of letters from each so that the remaining letters are anagrams.
How many letters must you remove?

Assume for purposes of this puzzle, an "anagram" does not have to be a valid English word.
It just represents a sequence of letters.
