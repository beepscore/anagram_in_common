class AnagramInCommon:
    """ Given two strings a and b, each contains only ascii lowercase a-z.

Returns minimum number of letters you must remove from each a and b so that the remaining letters are anagrams.
Assume for purposes of this puzzle, an "anagram" does not need to be a valid English word.
It just represents a sequence of letters."""
